    <td>
<p>28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
</p>

<p>29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

    <td>God's rest is a gift from Him, not just a discovery or an achievement of our own. It is connected to learning of Jesus and His meekness and lowliness of heart. It must be found, not just received, which implies that it is received after seeking. What we seek is Jesus, not the rest by itself.</td>

    <td>
<p>
2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
</p>
<p>
3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
</p>
    </td>
    <td>
<p>I have generally imagined God resting on the seventh day to be a statement about Him reacting to His fatigue. But in the context of the rest of God, I now think that this was less about Him taking a break to recuperate, and more about Him contemplating how His creation would fill its measure and bring joy. Despite all of the problems and flaws and hard things that come with an earthly experience, when all is said and done, the plan works, and we can trust in Him to bring us through safely. If God was enjoying His own rest, <em>that</em> would be what He would be contemplating and enjoying. 
</p>
<p>This changes the sabbath day from an echo of God taking a break, to an echo of rejoicing in God's overcoming of the world, and a day for appreciating His rest.

<p>11 And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.

<p>Moses was promised rest -- something that the Lord would give him. Moses was seeking to know the Lord's way and to know the Lord himself.

The Lord's presence is connected with receiving this rest. Moses was speaking with the Lord face to face, as a man speaks with his friend...

    <td>
<p>15 ¶ If ye love me, keep my commandments.
</p>

<p>16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;
</p>

<p>17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.
</p>

<p>18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
</p>

<p>21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

<p>23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

    <td>
<p>Making an abode with a person means inviting them to live there. If home is where the heart is, and home is where we rest from the cares of the world, then Jesus is promising rest here. The rest involves the ministrations of the First and Second Comforters.
</p>
<p>A precondition of receiving this gift is keeping the commandments.</p>

<p>In this scripture, Moses is telling the Israelites about political and social rest that the Lord will give them. Although that type of rest is not the deepest fulfillment of the Lord's promise to give us rest, it <em>is</em> a type and a shadow.
</p>
<p>The Lord gives rest; it is not something we achieve on our own. It is a rest from <em>all</em> our enemies. The last enemy that shall be conquered is death (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.26?lang=eng#p25">1 Cor 15:26</a>).
</p>
<p>Other enemies from which God can help us rest were named by Fosdick: "Some Christians carry their religion on their backs. It is a packet of beliefs and practices which they must bear. At times it grows heavy, and they would willingly lay it down, but that would mean a break with old traditions, so they shoulder it again. But real Christians do not carry their religion, their religion carries them. It is not weight; it is wings. It lifts them up, it sees them over hard places, it makes the universe seem friendly, life purposeful, hope real, sacrifice worthwhile. It sets them free from fear, discouragement, futility, and sin--the great enslavers of men's souls. You can know a real Christian, when you see him, by his buoyancy." <cite>12 Tests of Character</cite>.

<p>"That day" that this scripture refers to is the millennial day, when the Lord reigns personally on the earth and all creation is at peace. No one hurts or destroys, the child plays on the hole of the asp, the lion and the lamb lie down together.
</p>
<p>Receiving the rest of the Lord before that day consists of receiving the capacity to imagine and believe in that future day fully, thus entering into a condition of solace and confidence.

<p>10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)

12 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.

13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;

18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?

19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

<p>In the first part of this passage, Paul is quoting  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/95.8-11?lang=eng#p7">Ps 95:8-11</a>. Then he expounds on it. 
</p>
<p>Unbelief and disobedience prevent us receiving God's rest. The opposite is well summarized by Paul's phrase, "hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end."

<p>Work steadily and without grandiose acclaim to do the Lord's work, and be meek and lowly. Doing so will allow us to believe in the Lord's reassurance and timetable, and help us understand that He is in charge and able to do His own work. We will then be able to rest with confidence in Him.
