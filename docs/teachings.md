    <td>Neal A. Maxwell, "Brim with Joy", BYU Devotional, Jan 1996</td>
    <td>
<p>When we reach a point of consecration, our afflictions will be “swallowed up in the joy of Christ” (Alma 31:38). They will be put in a perspective that permits us to deal with them. With our steady pursuit of joy and with each increasing measure of righteousness, we will experience one more drop of delight—one drop after another—until, in the words of a prophet, our hearts are “brim with joy” (Alma 26:11). At last, the soul’s cup finally runs over! May you be sufficiently committed to be “alive in Christ,” even in the turbulent last days in which you will live. For, indeed, whatsoever afflictions you may have, they can be “swallowed up in the joy of Christ.” God’s hand is a loving hand, stretched out to love and to lead us, if we will, into a fullness of joy.
